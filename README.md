# Contract-Last SOAP Web Service

This project demonstrates the **contract-last approach** to building a SOAP-based web service. In a contract-last development style, the service logic is implemented first, and the WSDL (Web Services Description Language) file is generated from the code.

## Usage
- After starting the service, the WSDL file can be accessed at:
  ```bash
  http://localhost:8080/ws/service.wsdl
